This is how I modified the code:

- I added some variables to store the previous measurements of MAP, lambda value, and RPM.
- I added some thresholds for the differences between the predicted and measured pulse width, and between the current and previous measurements of MAP, lambda value, and RPM.
- I added some logic to check if these differences are larger than the thresholds, and if so, increase the process noise variance by a factor.
- I added some comments to explain the code.

I hope this code helps you with your project. Please note that this code is not tested or verified, and it may contain errors or bugs. You may need to adjust some parameters or values based on your specific application or hardware. You may also need to add some comments or documentation to explain your code better. If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know. ðŸ˜Š
